command-line voice-activated recorder.

This is a voice-activated recorder with a command line interface only (no GUI). When it's running it accepts single-letter commands:
* h - Print some help
* f - Print the current recording filename
* k - Print the peak and trigger levels
* q - Quit
* p - Start or stop the peak level meter
* r - Turn recording on/off
* v - Set the sound trigger level. You'll be prompted for a peak level
